Mind Marvel: Trivia Game 

Project Description: Drawing inspiration from "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?", Mind Marvel engages players in a quiz encompassing a diverse range of topics, spanning from world history to pop culture. Successfully answering each question results in a monetary reward. The challenge escalates progressively as questions become more intricate. To add an element of urgency, a time limit is imposed, and the game concludes if the player provides an incorrect answer. Subsequently, the game resets with a fresh set of randomly selected questions, maintaining variety and excitement. Throughout the gameplay, the system keeps track of the player's score within the defined time limits.
