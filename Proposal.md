Mind Marvel: Trivia Game 

Project Description: Drawing inspiration from "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?", Mind Marvel quizs players in a range of topics, spanning from world history to pop culture. Answering each question correctly results in a monetary reward. A time limit will exist, and the game will end if the player provides an incorrect answer. A new set of randomly selected questions will appear when the game starts over.
